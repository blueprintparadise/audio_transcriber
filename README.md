1 - I am not sure what you value more, speed or quality. Since this is a startup my bet is on speed. So I delivered this as quickly as I could.

2 - I have given a gradio UI as I personally hate cli based demo's. 

3 - Just create a new env (I prefer python 3.8), run pip install -r requirements and run the task_ui.py file.  (I can add step by step instuructions as well if you are looking for some documentation skills)

Personally I would love to use some LLM for the summarization as we can provide more context, but I hope this one works good enough.

As with litrally all code written in the last 6 months, I too have take help from ChatGPT uncle for guidence and code as no specific restrictions was mentioned in the email. Please let me know if you want something done the "Old' School way.

And finally,
Thanks.............
